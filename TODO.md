# TODOs:

- [ ] Add Plugin Support, e.g. styling for:
  - [ ] Tabs
  - [ ] Tag-Search
  - [ ] Outline on ToC
- [x] Light Theme Menu Button Color
- [x] Improve spacing on level one elements
  - _E.g. making some quick notes using only level-one items without further formatting and children, spacing between items is too large._

## Info

Most likely there are many more improvements to make.<br />
Admittedly I'm not using Loeqseq as my main PKM tool. I'll probably start using it as my main tool for the specific purpose of technical or study knowledge management in the near future.<br />
Therefore not being exposed to it regularly at the moment, I'm missing out on spotting those possible improvements.
So feel free to open an issue and let me know when you see something that can be improved.
