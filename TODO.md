# TODO:

- [ ] Increase font-size
- [ ] Background color in marketplace previews
- [ ] H5, H6 Size
- [ ] Bullet threading on block embed
- [ ] Remove strike from finished todos
- [ ] Border left bug for inline elements
  - [ ] Ask for experiences on Stack Overflow
- [ ] Find better text color
- [ ] Update `README.md` → Add how to change color scheme, Info to disable bullet threading plugin.
- [ ] Button colors for dark mode in delete dialog
  - Mental note. Uses `.bg-white` so target `.bg-white` in .dark-theme specified for buttons.
- [ ] Update icon
- [ ] Cleanup & Refactor CSS!
  - [ ] Add Comments & Table of Contents
- [x] Fix & improve spacing after inferences in last update
- [x] Better contrast / visual hint for links
- [x] Improve bullet threading on embedded / inline blocks
- [x] Horizontal line color
- [x] Light theme menu button color
- [x] Improve spacing on level one elements
  - _E.g. making some quick notes using only level-one items without further formatting and children, spacing between items is too large._

_Mental note:
Make commits to `TODO.md` better comparable not throwing them around - even though it can get unsorted and not that pretty. Add new items and leave rest as it is._

## Plugin Support

- [x] Tabs → releasing fork soon (\*)
  - [x] Styling
  - [ ] Move margin-top for main content from theme.css to tabs-plugin so it'll be added conditionally when the plugin is used
- [ ] Tag-Search
- [x] TOC Generator Plugin
  - [ ] Light theme background

_(\*)Due to integration of many plugins as iframe and the plugins missing implementation of logseq's `stlyes.css` and themes `custom.css`, it's hardly possible to style many plugins directly via theme css._

## Info

_Most likely there are many more improvements to make.<br />_
_Admittedly I'm currently not using Loegseq as my main PKM tool. I'll probably start doing so for the specific purpose of technical or study knowledge management in the near future.<br />_
_Therefore not being exposed to it regularly at the moment, I'm missing out on spotting those possible improvements.
So feel free to open an issue and let me know when you see something that can be improved._
