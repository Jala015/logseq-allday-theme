# [All Day Theme for logseq](https://github.com/tobealive/logseq-allday-theme)

A Theme that concentrates on providing the best workflow experience, high readability and minimal eye strain.

It attempts to accomplish this through styling decisions in typography, colors and spacing.<br />
Which results in an initially good overview of the note content section and reduces the need for manual line-breaks.

## Preview

## Instructions

Switching between dark / light mode is possible under `Settings → General → Theme modes`.

The theme's implemented bullet threading may be impaired when using the additional
_Bullet Threading_ plugin on top of it. If you have installed the plugin, I'll recommend turning it off while using the theme.

> **INFO:** New versions often Logseq might introduce changes that require adaptation of styles. If you experience an issue, we might have missed out on implementing it for a new version. Please feel free to open an issue and help to keep the theme even better up to date ❤️.

## Credits

Shout out to [dev theme](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-dev-theme). The integration of the bullet threading feature was based on their implementation of it. Great work!
