# All Day Theme for logseq

_Inspired to work with elegance and style._

Concentrating on providing the best workflow experiences: High readability and a look that won't exhaust the eyes. <br /> 
The theme tries to accomplish this through styling decisions in typography, colors and spacing.

It provides an initially good overview of the note content section, without  the need for additional manual line-breaks.

The base code for the bullet threading feature came from dev theme. Kudos to the devs.
