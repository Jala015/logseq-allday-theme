# All Day Theme for logseq

_Inspired to work with elegance and style._

_I concentrated on providing the best workflow experiences through readability and a look that won't exhaust the eyes._
_The theme tries to achieve this through its styling decisions in spacing, typography, and color._

_Providing an initially good overview of the note content section, without  the need to add manual line-breaks._
