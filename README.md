# [All Day Theme for logseq](https://github.com/tobealive/logseq-allday-theme)

A Theme that concentrates on providing the best workflow experience, high readability and minimal eye strain.

It attempts to accomplish this through styling decisions in typography, colors and spacing.<br />
Which results in an initially good overview of the note content section and reduces the need for manual line-breaks.

## Preview

## Instructions

Switching between dark / light mode is possible under Settingsâ†’General.

As the theme has implemented bullet threading, it can conflict with the
bullet threading plugin. I'll recommend turning the plugin off when using this theme.

Due to changes in the recent versions of Loegseq, please upgrade to current version<small>(0.5.9)</small>. The themes styling for some elements needed to be adapted to work in the new version.

## Credits

Shout out to [dev theme](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-dev-theme). The integration of the bullet threading feature was based on their implementation of it. Great work!
