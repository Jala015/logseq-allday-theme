# All Day Theme for logseq

Concentrating on providing the best workflow experience, high readability and minimal eye strain.

The theme tries to accomplish this through styling decisions in typography, colors and spacing.<br /> 
It gives an initially good overview of the note content section and reduces the need for manual line-breaks.
