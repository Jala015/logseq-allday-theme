# [All Day Theme for logseq](https://github.com/tobealive/logseq-allday-theme)

A Theme that concentrates on providing the best workflow experience, high readability and minimal eye strain.

It attempts to accomplish this through styling decisions in typography, colors and spacing.<br />
Which results in an initially good overview of the note content section and reduces the need for manual line-breaks.

## Preview

## Instructions

Switching between dark / light mode is possible under `Settings → General → Theme modes`.

The theme's implemented bullet threading may be impaired when using the additional
_Bullet Threading_ plugin on top of it. If you have installed the plugin, I'll recommend turning it off while using the theme.

To ensure the best functionality, please consider upgrading to Logseq v0.5.9+.
Due to changes in the recent versions, the theme's styling for some elements needed to be adapted to work with the new release and can look displaced in older versions now.

If you are upgrading from an old version of the All Day theme, clearing the cache can help if you are still experiencing issues like displacement of lines after an update `Settings → Advanced → Clear cache`. Note: After clearing the cache you need to reopen your graphs.

## Credits

Shout out to [dev theme](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-dev-theme). The integration of the bullet threading feature was based on their implementation of it. Great work!
