_I concentrated on providing the best workflow experiences through readability and a look that won't exhaust the eyes._
_The theme tries to achieve this through its styling decisions in spacing, typography, and color._

_Providing an initially good overview of the note content section, without  the need to add manual line-breaks._

## Additional Notes
The theme is designed to work with Dev themes bullet threading (It even enhances it. For example, the "jumpiness" when activating a line gets fixed).
It also works on its own but, but to have the best workflow experience I suggest activating the bullet threading only theme with All Days `custom.css`.

### To achieve this:
- Add the theme as custom.css in your vaults/graphs logseq dir
- Active developer mode in the settings
- Install "Dev theme" from the marketplace
- Active the bullet threading only theme.
