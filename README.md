# All Day Theme for logseq

A Theme that concentrates on providing the best workflow experience, high readability and minimal eye strain.

It attempts to accomplish this through styling decisions in typography, colors and spacing.<br /> 
Which results in an initially good overview of the note content section and reduces the need for manual line-breaks.
